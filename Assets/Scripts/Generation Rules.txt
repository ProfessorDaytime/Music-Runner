Rules to generation.  right now I am just using 0-9 and letters

0 = Empty Space
1 = Note at interval equal to itself
2 = Note at interval equal to itself
3 = Note at interval equal to itself
4 = Note at interval equal to itself
5 = Note at interval equal to itself
6 = Note at interval equal to itself
7 = Note at interval equal to itself
8 = Not currently Assigned
9 = Note at random interval

//A = Major Chord at Base Scale Note
//a = Minor Chord at Base Scale Note
//B = Major Chord at 2 Scale Note
//b = Minor Chord at 2 Scale Note
//C = Major Chord at 3 Scale Note
//c = Minor Chord at 3 Scale Note
//D = Major Chord at 4 Scale Note
//d = Minor Chord at 4 Scale Note
//E = Major Chord at 5 Scale Note
//e = Minor Chord at 5 Scale Note
//F = Major Chord at 6 Scale Note
//f = Minor Chord at 6 Scale Note
//G = Major Chord at 7 Scale Note
//g = Minor Chord at 7 Scale Note


a = Chord at Base Scale Note
b = Chord at 2 Scale Note
c = Chord at 3 Scale Note
d = Chord at 4 Scale Note
e = Chord at 5 Scale Note
f = Chord at 6 Scale Note
g = Chord at 7 Scale Note

r = random generation note, chord, obstacle, empty...
w = wall or obstacle// this will probably expand in the future
